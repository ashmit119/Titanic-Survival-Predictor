# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using a machine learning algorithm-RANDOM FOREST.

## Setup
If you have a Jupyter Notebook environment:

1. Open the `titanic_ML.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells step-by-step to see the code and results.

Or, if using Python :

1. Install required packages:
2. Open and run the `titanic_ML.ipynb` notebook.

## Files

- `titanic.csv` - dataset
- `titanic_ML.ipynb` - project code

## What it does

- Loads and cleans data
- Trains a Random Forest model
- Evaluates model accuracy
- Makes predictions on user inputed data
  
Feel free to explore and learn from the code!
